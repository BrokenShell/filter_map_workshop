# DS Workshop: Map, Filter and Friends

## 1. `implementation.py`
Shows possible implementations for `map` and `filter`. This is here to help us understand the signatures of these builtin functions. This code is not intended to be used in production.

## 2. `main.py`
This is a basic introduction to how to use `map` and `filter` with helper functions. These helper functions are used throughout the Workshop. Other functions would typically be used in production. This is serving as a contrived example of how to use `map` and `filter`.

## 3. `mapping.py`
This shows 4 flavors of mapping in Python, some good and some not so good.

## 4. `filtering.py`
This shows 3 flavors of filtering in Python, some good and some not so good.

## 5. `real_world.py`
This is a real world example of mapping and filtering together with more complex data and a tangible goal. This is more like real world code you might see in the wild.
